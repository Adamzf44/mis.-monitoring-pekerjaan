IMPORTANT: gradle-wrapper.jar (binary) is NOT included in this ZIP because it is generated by Gradle.
To make the Gradle wrapper fully functional, do one of the following:
1) On your development machine with Gradle installed, run in project root:
   gradle wrapper
   This will generate gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar and update scripts.
2) Or copy gradle-wrapper.jar from another Android project into gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
3) Alternatively, in GitHub Actions workflow you can install Gradle on the runner or adjust workflow to use system Gradle.

If you want, I can guide you step-by-step to generate the wrapper locally and then re-upload a complete ZIP including the gradle-wrapper.jar.
